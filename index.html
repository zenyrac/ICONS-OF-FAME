                story: "Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton was born in 1985 in Stevenage, UK. His father worked multiple jobs to fund his karting career. Facing racial prejudice as the only Black child at races, he endured slurs but persisted. At 13, he was signed to McLaren's program but struggled for sponsorship due to racism. His father remortgaged their home to keep his career alive. In 2007, he became F1's first Black driver. He won his first World Championship in 2008 with a dramatic last-lap overtake. With seven World Championships, he's the most successful driver in F1 history. Beyond racing, he founded Mission 44 to support underrepresented youth.",

                story: "Born in 1985 in Funchal, Madeira, Cristiano Ronaldo grew up in extreme poverty. His father battled alcoholism, and the family lived in a tin-roofed shack. His mother considered abortion due to their circumstances. At 12, he moved alone to Lisbon for training, where he was mocked for his accent and thin frame. At 15, he underwent heart surgery for tachycardia. Joining Manchester United in 2003, he transformed from a showy teen to a disciplined athlete. With five Ballon d'Or awards, he's considered one of football's greatest. Despite his wealth, he donates millions to hospitals and remains eligible for blood donation by avoiding tattoos.",

                story: "Michael Jackson was born in 1985 in Gary, Indiana. As the seventh of ten children, he endured physical abuse from his father while performing with the Jackson 5. His solo career began with 'Off the Wall' in 1979, but radio stations called it 'too Black for pop.' In 1982, he released 'Thriller,' which faced resistance from MTV until CBS threatened to pull all artists. His 1983 Moonwalk performance rewrote entertainment history. Despite his success, he battled vitiligo, media cruelty ('Wacko Jacko'), and painkiller addiction. Though he died $500M in debt, he had secretly donated over $500M to charity.",

In 1882, he discovered the rotating magnetic field—the foundation of AC power. Arriving in New York in 1884 with four cents, he worked for Edison who promised $50K for improved DC motors but called it a 'joke.' Tesla quit and dug ditches before finding backers for AC power. His innovations enabled modern power grids. He dreamed of free global wireless power with Wardenclyffe Tower, but funding was pulled and his lab destroyed. Tesla died alone in 1943, penniless, with the FBI seizing his papers. Today, the unit 'tesla' honors his legacy.",

Arrested in 1962, he spent 27 years in prison, 18 of them on Robben Island breaking rocks in lime quarries. He taught himself law in prison and secretly wrote memoirs on toilet paper. Released in 1990, he negotiated an end to apartheid and won the presidency in 1994, becoming South Africa's first Black president. He formed the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to heal national wounds and invited his jailers to his inauguration. Mandela won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 and remains a global symbol of reconciliation.",

Witnessing the liquidation of the Kraków Ghetto in 1942 transformed him. He spent his entire fortune bribing Nazi officials to protect his workers, creating 'Schindler's List' of 1,200 Jews essential to the war effort. He moved his factory to Czechoslovakia to save them from extermination camps. After the war, Schindler was penniless and relied on support from Jewish organizations. He died in 1974 and was honored as 'Righteous Among Nations' at Yad Vashem.",
